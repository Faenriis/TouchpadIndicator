touchpad-indicator is a minimalistic Touchpad management extension for the Gnome Shell.

touchpad-indicator allows you to switch your Touchpad On or Off, if a Trackpoint exists it is also possible to switch it On or Off through the extension (Needs 'xinput' to detect and switch the trackpoint).

There's further the possibility to automatically switch On or Off the touchpad and/or trackpoint if a mouse is detected at startup or if a mouse is plugged or 
The automatc switch off is disabled by default.

If your touchpad use synclient the extension also use synclient to switch the touchpad On or OFf and not the standard gsettings values of gnome-shell.

To choose your preferred option you could change the values below "Indicatorsettings".


To install, extract the archive or copy the folder to
~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ and restart the shell.


If you want to contribute you could translate this extension:

You have to open a terminal and change your directory:

cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/touchpad-indicator@orangeshirt/

Now you have to start a new translation file with:

msginit

After that you'll find a new file like de.po (where de is the language abbreviation of your language) in the directory above. Open this file with your prefered texteditor and change the strings to your language. That's it. Please push this file in github or send it to my email address (You could find them in the code of extension.js) If you would test your language file before you send it to me you have to do the following things:

mkdir -p locale/de/LC_MESSAGES

msgfmt de.po -o locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/touchpad-indicator@orangeshirt.mo

where 'de' is the language abbreviation of your translation. It is the same as for the .po file.

Now you could restart gnome-shell with Alt+F2 and 'r' or logout and in. Touchpad-indicator now should be shown in your language.
